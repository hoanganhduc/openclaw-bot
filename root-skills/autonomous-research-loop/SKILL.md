# Autonomous Research Loop

Use this skill to run research autonomously while preserving bounded scope,
evidence, recovery state, and explicit stop conditions. It is an orchestration
contract, not an instruction to run indefinitely.

## Core Rule

Every autonomous loop must have:

1. A concrete goal.
2. Success criteria.
3. Hard budgets.
4. A loop ledger.
5. Evidence gates.
6. Recovery notes.
7. Stop conditions.

If any of those are missing, create them before starting the first autonomous
iteration.

## When To Use

Use this skill for:

- Continuing nontrivial research across multiple iterations.
- Running source discovery, synthesis, verification, and revision without asking
  after every step.
- Coordinating bounded subagent research or panel review.
- Integrating autonomous behavior into an existing research workflow.
- Resuming a research loop after interruption or context compaction.

Do not use it for:

- Trivial one-shot lookups.
- User requests that explicitly ask only for a plan or analysis.
- Work that lacks a safe budget or stop condition.
- Blind command execution without inspectable evidence.

## Required Loop Files

For a research workspace, keep these files in the active research directory:

- `loop_state.json`: goal, success criteria, mode, stop flags, current status.
- `budget.json`: iteration, wall-clock, token, cost, depth, and child-agent limits.
- `iterations.jsonl`: append-only record of each loop iteration.
- `recovery.md`: latest resume point, blockers, next safe action, and evidence gaps.

If a runtime helper is available, prefer the companion
`autonomous-research-loop-runtime` skill to initialize and validate these files.
If it is not available, create the files manually in the same structure.

## Loop Modes

Choose the narrowest mode that can satisfy the goal:

- `monitor`: check whether new evidence or tasks exist, then stop if nothing
  changed.
- `bounded-research`: search, analyze, verify, and write within declared
  budgets.
- `implementation-support`: inspect code or docs, propose research-backed
  changes, and verify integration assumptions.
- `panel-loop`: use a bounded multi-agent discussion, then synthesize and
  verify the result.
- `recovery`: resume from `recovery.md`, validate state, and continue only from
  the recorded next action.

## Preflight

Before starting an autonomous run:

1. State the scope and material exclusions.
2. Define success criteria in observable terms.
3. Set hard budgets:
   - maximum iterations
   - maximum wall time or user-visible turns
   - maximum child workers
   - maximum source hops or search depth
   - maximum spend or token budget when applicable
4. Define stop conditions:
   - success criteria met
   - budget exhausted
   - evidence gap remains after the retry limit
   - user intent changes
   - tool, credential, or permission blocker prevents safe progress
   - repeated plateau according to the declared plateau rule
5. Initialize or validate the loop files.

The maximum iteration budget is a hard cap, not a target to exceed while
searching for success. A loop may run fewer iterations when success or a true
hard stop condition occurs, but it must never append more than
`max_iterations` records. A normal early `stop` before the final allowed
iteration is valid only when the success criteria are met and the iteration
cites a machine-checkable proof/success artifact. Otherwise continue, revise,
delegate, or mark the loop `blocked` with the blocker recorded.

## Iteration Protocol

Each iteration must record:

- iteration number
- timestamp
- mode
- objective
- evidence checked
- actions taken
- output produced
- remaining gaps
- budget consumed or estimated
- decision: `continue`, `revise`, `delegate`, `stop`, or `blocked`

Only use a continuing decision (`continue`, `revise`, or `delegate`) when the
next iteration has a concrete objective and remaining budget. The final allowed
iteration must be terminal (`stop` or `blocked`); if success criteria have not
been satisfied by then, stop as budget exhausted instead of leaving the loop
`running`. Before the final allowed iteration, `stop` must mean success/proof
found and must cite at least one evidence id that resolves to a proof artifact.

## Evidence Gates

Apply the relevant gates before accepting an iteration output:

- Source claims require source IDs or file references.
- Current facts require dated source checks.
- Early proof/success stops require an evidence id backed by a local
  machine-checkable proof artifact, such as
  `proof_artifacts/<evidence_id>.json`, whose checker metadata reports a
  passed check and whose proof file exists in the loop directory.
- Code or workflow changes require local inspection of relevant files.
- Multi-agent conclusions require synthesis that separates agreement,
  disagreement, assumptions, and unresolved questions.
- Recommendations must distinguish confirmed evidence from inference.

If a gate fails, record the failure in `iterations.jsonl` and choose one of:

- retry with a narrower objective
- delegate a bounded check
- revise the scope
- stop as blocked

## Multi-Agent Use

When using subagents:

1. Create bounded task packets with objective, evidence required, exclusions,
   and expected output.
2. Limit child workers to the budget in `budget.json`.
3. Require each child result to report inspected and uninspected evidence.
4. Synthesize child outputs before making decisions.
5. Do not let child agents recursively start unbounded loops.

For panel-style discussion, pair this skill with `agent-group-discuss` or
`prose` when available.

## Recovery

After every material iteration, update `recovery.md` with:

- current goal
- last completed iteration
- current status
- next safe action
- remaining evidence gaps
- active blockers
- budget remaining

On resume, read `loop_state.json`, `budget.json`, `iterations.jsonl`, and
`recovery.md` before acting. Validate state before continuing.

## Stop Rules

Stop immediately and report status when:

- success criteria are satisfied
- any hard budget is exhausted
- the same blocker repeats for three consecutive iterations
- evidence needed for the conclusion cannot be obtained
- the user asks to pause, stop, or switch tasks
- the next action would mutate code, config, credentials, or external systems
  beyond the approved scope

When stopping, report:

- status: complete, stopped, or blocked
- iterations completed
- evidence inspected
- remaining unchecked items
- next recommended action

## Output Contract

For user-visible summaries, use this compact shape:

```text
Scope: ...
Status: ...
Evidence Checked: ...
Iterations: ...
Decision: ...
Remaining Gaps: ...
Next Action: ...
```

If material evidence remains unchecked, explicitly say `incomplete analysis`
before the provisional recommendation.
